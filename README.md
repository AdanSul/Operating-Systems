# Operating Systems

This repository contains hands-on assignments exploring core **Operating System** concepts, including process management, concurrency, memory management, and kernel development.

## ðŸ“Œ Assignments Overview

### Assignment 1: Building a Simple Shell
Implemented a custom **shell** that supports executing commands in the foreground and background, maintaining a **history** of commands, and re-executing past commands using history references.

### Assignment 2: Multithreaded Linked List with Synchronization
Developed a **thread-safe linked list** using **pthreads** and synchronization mechanisms. Implemented **concurrent insertions, deletions, and counting operations** while ensuring safe parallel execution.

### Assignment 3: Kernel Module for Encrypted Device Driver
Created a **Linux kernel module** simulating an **encryption device driver**, supporting **Caesar Cipher and XOR Cipher** encryption. Implemented **read/write operations, ioctl commands**, and encryption key handling.

### Assignment 4: Virtual Memory and Page Table Simulation
Simulated **virtual-to-physical memory translation** using **page tables and TLB caching**. Implemented **page fault handling, memory mapping, and address translation** for efficient memory access.
